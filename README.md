# Fraud-Detection

Hello!

This is a code repo documenting my various attempts to model instances of fraud using data from Kaggle's IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection competition. While I ended up placing relatively poorly (about 5000 out of 6300) I ended up learning a lot. I'm still conducting a lot of experiments with different models and ways to create features, so if some notebooks appear messy or unfinished, I apologise! I have divided up my work into two main phases which I separate based on the maturity of my analysis. I've also experimented with using Sagemaker from AWS, but it doesn't seem to be yielding fruitful results ironically becase of an apparent lack of computational power. 

## Phase I
